                    <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
                    <p>Web development is the art and science of building web pages, sites and applications for the Internet.
                        The primary technologies of web development are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can learn more about
                        them and about getting started in web development right here.</p>

                    <h2>Web Development Tools</h2>
                    <p>All you need to get started in web development is a computer, a web browser, and a code editor. There
                        are many different kinds of each. Any sort of laptop will do, whether a PC, Mac or even a Linux laptap.
                        Even Chromebooks will work for development, though you'll need to be creative with tools.</p>
                    <p>Our recommended code editor is <a href="https:code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>,
                        which is a free, cross-platform editor. VS Code might be free but don't let that fool you, it is
                        a professional quality tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>The basics of VS Code are easy to pick up but you can learn more about it with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q1tD39Mk_A"

                    <h2>Basic HTML</h2>
                    <img src="images/html.png" />
                    <p>HTML is a <em>mark-up language</em> used to place content on a web page. The text and images you see
                        on a web site are placed using HTML.</p>
                    <p>HTML is encoded using tags like &lth1>, &lth2> and &ltp>. Each tag is usually followed by content, and
                        then a closing tag like this: &ltp>your content here&lt/p></p>
                    <p>Good HTML markup is the foundation of an organized, good-looking site.</p>

                <div class="copy">
                    <h2>Placing Images</h2>
                    <p>Images are placed using tags like other HTML elements but images have a syntax that includes the source
                        of the image: the file location of the image the developer wants to use. Unlike most HTML tags img
                        does not use a closing tag. Instead it just adds a "/" at the end of its opening tag. Here's an example:
                        &ltimg src="my-image-name.jpg"/>
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <div class="copy">
                    <h2>Anchor Tags (links)</h2>
                    <p>Anchor tags are used to link to other areas in a web page or even to different pages entirely. Anchor
                        tags work by adding an <em>href</em> to the starting tag. This will control where the user who clicks
                        on the tag ends up. They look like this: &lta href="www.google.com">Go to Google&lt/a>. Note: The
                        text between the opening and closing tags doesn't do anything to control the link. It is there just
                        to help your user understand what to do.

                        <h2>Using Divs</h2>
                        <p>Divs can't be seen on a web page but they are an essential part of keeping a site clean and organized.
                            Divs can help with styling and with keeping site content with different topics separated.</p>
                        <p>Divs are very important and most websites use a lot of them. Sometimes they can be hard to keep track
                            of but a good code editor can help with this.</p>

                        <h2>CSS</h2>
                        <img src="images/css3.png" />
                        <p>CSS is a stylesheet language using to control the appearance of a webpage. With CSS a developer can
                            control color, fonts, image sizes, layout and more. CSS has a steeper learning curve than HTML
                            and it can be a little frustrating to work with until you get the hang of it.</p>
                        <p>That being said, CSS is very powerful. With it you can radically alter the appearance of a web page
                            to convey a brand, a certain feeling, or just to look awesome. Even animating elements is possible
                            with CSS.

                <h2>How to Learn More About Web Development</h2>
                <p>Try the follow steps to get started:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to <a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">Dash</a> and see if you can complete the
                        first three exercises. You can do them all if you want to but if you can complete the first three
                        you've got what it takes to learn web development.</li>
                    <li>Get a bit more of a foundation in computer science. Try <a href="https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/CS101/Summer2014/about"
                            target="_blank">this introductory course</a> at Stanford University. Don't worry, no math or programming
                        background is required. It's a short course and you can probably finish it in a week or two.</li>
                    <li>Now that you've got a bit of background, sign up at <a href="https://freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>                        and try to complete the front-end certificate. This is not an easy challenge and will take several
                        months. If you get the certificate and want to go even deeper, check out the other certs offered
                        at FCC. All of their lessons and certifications are free.</li>
                    <li>For more information about learning to code online check out <a href="www.codeslo.com/learning-to-code-online"
                            target="_blank">this blog post</a> on the CodeSLO website.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Doing anything well is hard, and so becoming a skilled web developer is also hard. The best thing to do is
                    to get involved in active communities of other developers like those you'll find at a University, or
                    at Free Code Camp, or at our local coding group <a href="www.codeslo.com" target="_blank">CodeSLO</a>.
                    The next thing you can do is to code a little every day. Try for just an hour a day to start. Lastly,
                    remember that something being hard is okay. Believe in yourself, don't be afraid to ask questions, and
                    never give up!</p>
